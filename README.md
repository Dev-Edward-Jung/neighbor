## ✨ What I Learned

### 🧩 Challenges  
Implementing the comment feature was difficult because all data had to be exchanged through JSON using AJAX.

### 🔧 Solutions  
I explored different ways to handle JSON data transfer, especially combining file uploads with text data like comments.  
Through Google searches and trial-and-error, I tried different methods—such as converting to JSON objects and experimenting with `form-data`—to solve the problem.

### 🤝 Importance of Communication  
During team collaboration using Git, we faced several merge conflicts and other issues.  
I learned how critical communication is when working in a team environment.

### 🌟 Final Thoughts  
Seeing the data appear dynamically on the screen was truly exciting and motivating.  
While working on the backend, many of the abstract concepts I had about Spring became clearer and more concrete.  
This project gave me a great sense of achievement—it showed me that “I can do it” through consistent effort.
